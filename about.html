                <p>my friend? duh? UHMMM noo ayu is totally more than a friend to me. she's my nUMBBEER one friend since she's always been there for me — steadfast, reliable, and trusting. in short, Ayu is my ride or die. but, who exactly is ayu? ayu, or to give her full name, AYU ARDIYATI NURAINI JOYO ATMOJ-pheww that IS LONG is an individual who was born on April 3rd, 2004 (I REMEMBER OK!!!!) (SORRY).  but let’s not define ayu by her birthdate since IM BADDD at remembering someone’s birthdate. ayu is a beacon of kindness, with a heart that’s as big as the sky and chock-full of love and compassion for everyone. ayu often gave a lot of reassurance and her words are like a MAGIC. ayu is moreee than just a person— she’s a friend you can count on, a confidant, a guide, and a piece of my life I would never want to be without.
